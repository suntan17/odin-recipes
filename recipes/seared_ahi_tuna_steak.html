    <p><h3>Why Ahi Tuna Steaks?</h3></p>

    <p></p>If I can get dinner on the table in less than 30 minutes, 
    I’m a happy camper. Under 20? Even better. But under TEN? It’s 
    almost too good to be true! But this one is DEFINITELY true.</p>

    <p></p>So true that we’ve made these Six-Minute Seared Ahi Tuna 
    Steaks twice in the past two weeks and fully plan on doing it again 
    this coming week.</p>
    
    <p></p>As you may have guessed from the title, this recipe only 
    takes about six minutes, and it’s absolutely mouthwateringly 
    delicious. And healthy. And EASY! What more could you want?</p>

   <h3><p>How to sear the tuna steaks</p></h3>
   <p>The fact that the tuna is served medium-rare accounts for its extremely 
    fast cooking time. Just marinate the tuna in a mixture of soy sauce, 
    oil, salt, and pepper (with some cayenne for some heat, if you want) 
    preferably for at least ten minutes, or overnight.

    <p>For a typical ahi tuna steak (about 1.5″ thick), sear on each side for 
    about two minutes (less time for rare; more time for medium). I 
    recommend using a nonstick skillet for this, or a very well seasoned 
    cast iron skillet (fish has a tendency to stick, and you don’t want to 
    risk the beautiful seared outer layer sticking to the pan!).</p>

    <p>Also, it’s important to get the pan SEARING hot before adding the fish. 
    You want the outside to cook very quickly, while leaving the inside raw, 
    so it should be as hot as possible before beginning to sear. I usually 
    heat the pan for 3-5 minutes.</p>

    <h3><p>Ingredients</p></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 ahi tuna (yellowfin tuna) steaks (about 4 oz. each, 1" thick – see notes for thinner or thicker)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil see notes</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon honey see notes</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon canola oil or olive oil</li>
        <li>green onions, toasted sesame seeds, and lime wedges for serving (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><p>Instructions</h3></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Pat the ahi tuna steaks dry with a paper towel. Place on a plate or inside a plastic bag.</li>
            <li>Mix the soy sauce (2 tablespoons), toasted sesame 
                oil (1 tablespoon), honey (1 tablespoon) kosher 
                salt (1/2 teaspoon- OMIT if marinating for more than a 
                couple hours, see notes), pepper (1/4 teaspoon), and 
                cayenne pepper (1/4 teaspoon) until honey is fully 
                dissolved. Pour over the ahi tuna steaks and turn over 
                to coat completely. Optional: allow to marinate for at 
                least 10 minutes, or up to overnight in the refrigerator. 
                Also optional: Reserve a spoonful or two of the marinade 
                before coating the fish for drizzling on top after you've 
                cooked it.</li>
            <li>Heat a medium skillet (preferably non-stick or a 
                well-seasoned cast iron skillet) on medium-high to high 
                until very hot ( or medium medium-high for nonstick). 
                I recommend giving cast iron 3-5 minutes to get hot and 
                nonstick about 1 minute, depending on how thick it is.</li>
            <li>Add the canola oil (1 tablespoon) to the hot pan. Sear 
                the tuna for 1 – 1½ minutes on each side for medium rare 
                ( 2 -2½ minutes for medium-well to well, 30 seconds for 
                very rare. See notes – this will vary based on thickness 
                of the tuna steaks). (Note: different burners get hotter 
                depending on your stove. Use your best judgement whether
                you use medium, medium-high, or high heat, as the 
                marinade may burn if too high heat is used)</li>
            <li>Remove to a cutting board. Slice into 1/2 inch slices 
                and serve garnished with green onions, toasted sesame 
                seeds, and a squeeze of fresh lime juice, if desired.</li>
            <li>ENJOY!</li>
        </ol>
