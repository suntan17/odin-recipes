    <p>Mango Salsa with a blue bowl and one chip</p>

    <p><h3>This mango salsa will give you something to shout about!</h3></p>
        <p>
        It’s irresistibly sweet and spicy, super simple to make, and 
        outrageously delicious. Plus, it’s so colorful that it almost 
        looks like confetti up-close.

        Come to think of it, salsa is actually the perfect anniversary 
        recipe since my first recipe was for salsa. That post broke 
        records for this blog back then. Three comments in one day!
