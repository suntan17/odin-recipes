    <p><h3>Better watch your "sweet tooth"!</h3></p>
        <p>This bright-gold sorbet is packed with fresh, vibrant flavor. 
        Enjoy it as is, or alongside a slice of cake — angel-food, 
        pound cake, yellow cake, and hot milk cake (pictured with the 
        sorbet) are all good choices.
        </p>
    <p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>
        <p><ul>
            <li>3 to 3 1/2 cups (about 907g) mango purée, from about 4 large mangoes</li>
            <li>1/3 cup (74g) water</li>
            <li>1/4 cup (85g) light corn syrup or honey</li>
            <li>1/3 cup (74g) lemon juice or lime juice, freshly squeezed</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons (43g) vodka, Grand Marnier, or Cointreau, optional; for texture</li>
        </ul></p>
    <p><h3>Directions</h3></p>
        <p><ol>
            <li>Peel the mangoes, discard the pits, and process in a food 
            processor or blender until nearly smooth; a few small lumps 
            can remain. Measure to make sure you have 3 to 3 1/2 cups 
            purée.</li>

            <li>Add the water, syrup or honey, lemon or lime juice, and 
            salt, stirring to combine.</li>

            <li>Place the mixture in the refrigerator, and chill thoroughly; 
            overnight is best. If you're going to use an ice cream 
            maker, make sure the freezer bowl is in the freezer. Again, 
            overnight is best.</li>

            <li>Next day, pour the mango mixture into the bowl of the ice 
            cream maker. Flip the switch, and let the sorbet freeze for 
            20 to 25 minutes, until thickened to the consistency of 
            soft-serve ice cream.</li>
        
            <li>If you're using the vodka or liqueur, add it at the end.</li>

            <li>Transfer the sorbet to a freezer container, cover it, and 
            place in the freezer compartment of your refrigerator until 
            it's as hard as you like; this will probably take a minimum 
            of several hours.</li>
    
            <li>To make the sorbet without an ice cream maker: Place the 
            mango mixture in a shallow pan; an 8" x 8" or 9" round cake 
            pan are both good choices. Place the pan in the freezer. 
            There's no need to cover it.</li>

            <li>After 2 hours, use a fork or spoon to stir it around, 
            bringing the frozen edges into the center. Return to the 
            freezer.</li>

            <li>Continue to stir every hour or so, until the sorbet is 
            nearly as firm as you like. This may be as little as 4 hours 
            total, start to finish; or it may take longer, depending on 
            the temperature of your freezer.</li>

            <li>Once the sorbet is entirely icy (like a slush drink), add 
            the alcohol, if you're using it. Rather than add the alcohol
            while the sorbet is still in its shallow pan, transfer the 
            sorbet to a lidded storage bowl. Stir in the alcohol, then 
            cover the bowl and place it in the freezer. Let the sorbet 
            "ripen" (freeze), undisturbed, for several more hours, until 
            it's as hard as you like.</li>
            <li>Try not to eat to much!</li>
        </ol></p>
