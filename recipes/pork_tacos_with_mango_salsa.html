    <p>Four Pork Tacos with Mango Salsa</p>
    <h3><p>I think fall is here for real.</p></h3>
    
    <p> It’s a bright sunny morning, but only 43 degrees…..brrrrr!  But 
        that’s OK because I’ve got a great taco recipe and tacos taste 
        great no matter what the temperature…right?</p>

    <p> These tacos are made in minutes if your freezer is stocked with 
        pulled pork.  Click here for my slow cooker pulled pork recipe.  
        If you have the pulled pork on hand, then all you have to do is 
        heat that up, add some taco seasoning to it and make the salsa.  
        Dinner’s on the table in less that 30 minutes!</p>
        
    <p> If you don’t happen to have any pulled pork, you could use a 
        rotisserie chicken and that would be delicious as well.  I 
        should let you know that this recipe is fairly spicy, so if you 
        want to tone it down, there are a couple of things you can do.  
        I used half a packet of Trader Joe’s taco seasoning (which is 
        pretty spicy) to season the pork.  If you wanted it to be 
        milder, just add less seasoning, try just a quarter of a packet. 
        I added a whole jalapeno to the salsa, so it has a kick as well. 
        If you didn’t want a lot of heat, try adding  just half of a 
        jalapeno.</p>
        
    <p> The end result is so flavorful and tasty.  It’s spicy, but the 
        mango and the pork go together so wonderfully and the sweetness 
        of the mango helps to cool things down a bit.  Give these tacos 
        a try and see for yourself how delicious they are!
